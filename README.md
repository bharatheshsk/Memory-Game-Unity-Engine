# 🧩 Android Memory Game using Unity Engine 🎮

## 📱 Overview

A **Memory Game** 🧩✨ is a timeless and fun puzzle game where players flip over cards to find matching pairs. This simple game helps improve concentration 🧠, focus 🔍, and recall skills. Using the **Unity Engine** 🎮 makes developing a memory game for **Android devices** 📱 smooth and enjoyable for developers of all skill levels.

## 🎮 How It Works

The core idea of the game is simple: players tap 👆 on cards laid out face-down in a grid 🗂️. When a card is flipped, it reveals an image 🖼️. Players then flip a second card to try to find a matching pair ✅. If the two cards match, they stay face-up 😃. If they don’t match, they flip back 🔄 after a short delay ⏳, challenging the player to remember the card positions 🧠.

## 🛠️ How It’s Done with Unity

1. **Card Prefabs 📦:**  
   Each card is built as a prefab in Unity with:
   - A **front sprite** (the hidden image) 🖼️
   - A **back sprite** (the default card back) 🔙
   - A **Collider2D** to detect touches ⚡
   - A **flip animation** 🔄 using Animator or a custom C# script 📜

2. **Grid Layout 🗂️:**  
   Cards are arranged in a grid using Unity’s **Grid Layout Group** or manual positioning 📏. The layout is flexible and scales well for different difficulty levels — from a 2x2 grid 👶 to larger grids like 4x4 or 6x6 🏆.

3. **Game Logic 💻:**  
   The main logic is handled by a **Game Manager script** 🗂️:
   - Tracks which cards are flipped 👀
   - Checks for matches ✅
   - Flips unmatched pairs back 🔄
   - Shuffles the cards 🔀
   - Updates the score 🏅 and timer ⏱️

4. **UI & Audio 🎵:**  
   Unity’s **Canvas system** 🖌️ is used to build:
   - Menus 📋 (Play, Restart, Exit)
   - Scoreboards 📊
   - Timers ⏰
   - Sound effects 🔊 for flipping cards, matches, and winning 🎉
   - Optional background music 🎶

5. **Animations & Effects ✨:**  
   Smooth card flip animations 🔄, match effects 🌟, and simple particle systems 🎇 make the game feel polished and satisfying.

6. **Build & Deploy 🚀:**  
   Unity’s build settings make it easy to export the game as an **APK or AAB** 📦. Developers can test touch interactions on real Android devices using **Unity Remote** 📲.
